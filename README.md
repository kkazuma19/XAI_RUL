# XAI_RUL
Machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are increasingly used in energy and engineering systems, but these models must be fair, unbiased, and explainable. It is critical to have confidence in AI's trustworthiness. ML techniques have been useful in  predicting important parameters and improving model performance. However, for these AI techniques to be useful for making decisions, they need to be audited, accounted for, and easy to understand. Therefore, the use of <b>Explainable AI (XAI)</b> and <b>interpretable machine learning (IML)</b> is crucial for the accurate prediction of prognostics, such as <b>remaining useful life (RUL)</b> in a  digital twin system to make it intelligent while ensuring that the AI model is transparent in its decision-making processes and that the predictions it generates can be understood and trusted by users. By using AI that is explainable, interpretable, and trustworthy, intelligent digital twin systems can make more accurate predictions of RUL, leading to better maintenance and repair planning and, ultimately, improved system performance.
